# Python-Project---Guess-the-Word-Game

This game is for beginners learning to code in python and to give them a little 
brief about using strings, loops and conditional(If, else) statements.

In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which our interpreter will 
choose 1 random word. The user first has to input number of gusses and length of the word and then, will be 
asked to guess any alphabet. If the random word contains that alphabet, it will 
be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask you 
to guess another alphabet. User will be given limited turns(can be changed 
accordingly) to guess the complete word.

Note : Guess the Word(Game) file is an executable file which can directly let you play
       the game without executing the code.
